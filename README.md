Data Management Plan for the research project sCO2 applications in radial cooling.

Context of the project: 
The project I am working on as a part of my research involves the use of super critical carbon dioxide (sCO2) as a coolant for surfaces with a high heat flux. Small surfaces like computer chips dissipate large amounts of thermal energy over a small surface area, creating high fluxes that require cooling in order to operate. sCO2 provides a phase change in which heat can be absorbed without the worry of critical heat fluxes present in pool boiling. My research involves using curved cold plates of different radii filled with moving CO2. A copper block is heated from beneath the cold plate in order to simulate thermal conditions of a curved surface in an effort to thermally ‘push’ the CO2 into supercriticality.
